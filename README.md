# OPD & Doctor Performance Analytics

This project is part of the Python Internship evaluation for **Neuralbits Technologies Pvt. Ltd.**  
It involves generating a synthetic OPD dataset, executing SQL-based analytics tasks, and producing insights through visualizations.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This repository contains:
- SQL queries for 8 analytical tasks  
- Python scripts for dataset generation (80,000+ OPD visits)  
- Visualizations for each task  
- Explanation PDF describing the logic behind every query  
- Cleaned and analysis-ready dataset files  

The project evaluates operational, clinical, and financial performance metrics across branches, doctors, diagnoses, medicines, and patient visit behavior.
